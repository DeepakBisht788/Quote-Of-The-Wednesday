# Motivational Quote Emailer
This Python script sends a motivational quote via email every Wednesday (or any specified day). The script reads quotes from a quotes.txt textfile, selects one randomly, and sends it using the SMTP protocol. 

## Features
- **Random Quote Selection**: Selects a random quote from a text file (`quotes.txt`).
- **Automated Email Sending**: Automatically sends the selected quote via email if the script is executed on the specified day of the week.
- **Day-Specific Execution**: Configured to send emails on a particular day (e.g., Wednesday).
